# POWER BI: BUSINESS INSIGHTS 360

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

AtliQ Hardware, a leading provider of computer hardware and peripherals globally, operates through diverse distribution channels such as retail, direct sales, and distributor networks, both online and offline. Despite its global reach, AtliQ faced significant financial setbacks due to reliance on static Excel reports that lacked actionable insights, particularly affecting operations in Latin America.

To address these challenges, AtliQ Hardware has mobilized a dedicated data analytics team to develop a dynamic solution: the Business Insights 360 Power BI dashboard, which is designed to offer real-time, actionable insights crucial for informed decision-making.
